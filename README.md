# Book-recommendation-AI-Bot

This innovative project leverages the OpenAI API to create a personalized book recommendation system. Users interact with the AI through a user-friendly interface, where they can specify their preferred book genre. The system then processes this input and provides tailored book suggestions that align with the user's interests. By integrating cutting-edge AI technology, this project aims to enhance the book discovery experience, making it easier for users to find their next great read based on their genre preferences.
